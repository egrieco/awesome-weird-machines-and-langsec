# Awesome Weird Machines and Langsec

Cybersecurity has traditionally been pushed forward through practical research and exploits without a deeper understanding or language to discuss the fundamental concepts and aspects of exploits. This repo is a place to collect links and papers discussing "weird machines" and techniques to mitigate them such as language-theoretic security and formal verification of software.

## Introductory Papers

Start with the two following papers:

* [Exploit Programming-Bratus.pdf](references/Exploit Programming-Bratus.pdf)
* [Weird Machines, Exploitability, and Provable Unexploitability-Dullien.pdf](references/Weird Machines, Exploitability, and Provable Unexploitability-Dullien.pdf)
